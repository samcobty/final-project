## Live Demo
https://final-project-st2l.onrender.com/

## Project Overview
I created a virtual take a penny, leave a penny tray. It allows users to enter their name and "leave" and/or "pick up" pennies. They can view how other users interact with the tray through an interactive log. Users can also interact with the pennies by dragging them around the tray.

## Endpoints
GET to retrieve all pennies
POST to create new penny
PUT to update the status of a penny if it is "taken"

## Technologies Used
    - **Languages**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    - **Other**: Gemini for some front end javascript code
